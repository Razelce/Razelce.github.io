								<p>Dear Sir/Madam, <br /> <br />
									
									I have spent the past 2+ years doing number crunching, database management and analysis for an oil and gas business, and I am keen to continue developing my career in the field of dats analysis. I have always been a numbers person, with exceptional mathematics and computer skills. I am fluent in several data management systems and business intelligence software, including Excel, MsSQL, PowerBi, Tableau and MSBI. Statistical significance, A/B testing, and data-driven optimization are the rhythm of the drumbeat I march to. I am currently advancing my Project Mangement Skills. <br /><br />

									As much as I’m into data manipulation, it’s the analysis of data that really gets me going. I like to explore the relationships between numbers and translate digits and spreadsheets into stories. In the age of big data, these stories become actionable solutions and strategies for businesses, and I take pride in my ability to make data accessible to both executive decision-makers and frontline sales staff. <br /><br />
									
									On a personal level, I am detail-oriented, organized, and precise in my work; the only thing cleaner than my room are my spreadsheets. I have strong communication skills with a knack for clear and illuminating presentation. I’m comfortable on my own facing the numbers, but I really enjoy being part of a motivated team of smart people. <br /><br />
									
									I appreciate your time spent reading this letter and look forward to connecting in the future. <br /><br />
									
									Sincerely, 				<br />
									Amara Olisa
									</p>
